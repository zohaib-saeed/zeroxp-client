    <div class="box-1"> 
        <p class="abouttext">In recent years, applying to entry-level jobs has become cumbersome. Despite job boards having filters for entry-level roles, many still demand years of experience. This forces applicants to individually check each job description for eligibility, not to mention the additional time spent manually entering information when applying through third-party portals. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p class="abouttext">ZeroXP addresses these issues experienced firsthand by its founding team. The platform scrapes and aggregates jobs, utilizing AI to assess intent, validate required experience, and curate listings for those with 0-1 years of experience or internships. It provides a focused, dynamic, and streamlined entry-level job board experience, including estimated salary data and company reviews.</p>
        <br></br>
